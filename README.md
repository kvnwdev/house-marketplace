# App Marketplace Demo

## By Kevin Willoughby

This is a small project I made while taking a React front end course. Shoutout Brad Traversy for the course.

## Usage

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Ensure you have a google geocode api key stored as `REACT_APP_GEOCODE_API_KEY` in the environment.
